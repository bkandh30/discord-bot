# ü§ñ Build Your Own Discord Bot

A Python-based implementation of a custom Discord bot, developed as a solution to [John Crickett's Coding Challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-discord).

This project uses the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to create an interactive bot that responds to user commands and messages within a Discord server.

## üìÑ Features

Once added to a Discord server and successfully hosted, the bot offers the following functionalities:

### üîπ Basic Interaction
- Responds to any `Hello` message with:
  ```
  Hello there, <user-display-name>
  ```

### üîπ Commands

- `!add <url>`  
  Adds a new coding challenge (provided as a URL) to a local JSON file.

- `!challenge`  
  Suggests a random challenge from the stored list.

- `!list`  
  Lists all saved coding challenges.

- `!quote`  
  Fetches and displays a random quote using the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/quotes/random).

- `!info`  
  Displays creator or bot information.
